1. The three elements of a map that are sources of distortion are (1) scale, (2) projection, and (3) symbolization.

3. By virtue of being two dimensional, map projections necessarily have distortion. How, and where best to distort a map, is the purview of the cartographer. Conformal map projections seek preserve shapes and angles, while equal-area map projections preserve the fidelity of area. Neither can be 'right' in any meaningful sense of the word, but one distortion might be preferable to another for the purposes of the particular map depending on scale, features, stylistic preferences, or other considerations.
